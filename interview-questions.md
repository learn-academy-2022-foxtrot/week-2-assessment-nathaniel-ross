# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: Parameters and arguments are similar but parameters are the variables inside of the function, and arguments are the variables that are the ouput of the function 

Researched answer: Parameters are the variables that are being used inside of a definition of a function. Arguments are the actual values that are being passed through the function when it is called. 

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: The built in map method takes three parameters; value, index, and array. I believe the first parameter value is always used, while index and array can be optional.

Researched answer: The higher-order function .map() takes three parameters. Value is the only required parameter which is the value of the array. Index shows the index of the array and is optional. Array is also optional and is the array that the higher order function was used on. 

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: Map is used to return an array of the same length, after using it to modify the array. Filter is used if you want to return an array with specific parts of the array, not needing to be the same length as you are filtering out what you would want.

Researched answer: Map is used to create a new array with with the same length, after being manipulated however desired. If you have an array with 5 elements, it will return 5 elements, but those 5 can be changed however you set the function to do so. Filter will create an array that can be a different length than the original array, as it only brings forward the elements that your function has been set to bring forward. If you have an array with 5 elements, but you want to filter 3 elements that share a common characteristic, you would use .filter to extract those elements, and your new array would only output those 3 elements. 

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is used in for loops to repeat a functionality repeatedly.

Researched answer: Iteration is used when you want to loop a functionality repeatedly, in a predetermined amount of loops. If you wanted something to loop five times, you would use a for loop to iterate a function to loop 5 times

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: A class is a blueprint for objects, so objects would be within the actual class

Researched answer: Class is a blueprint for objects to be created in, while Objects are just an instance inside of a class. Classes are used to group similar objects together using the 'class' keyword in PascalCase. 

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: I have never heard of hoisting, but I feel like it has to do with moving some sort of functionality around in JavaScript, hoisting or pulling it somewhere within your code.

Researched answer: Variable hoisting in JavaScript allows you to access variables before they're declared. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: User stories are used in programming to plan out essentially what will be filled in later. It's written from the perspective of the end user, to show what to expect from a user perspective.

2. Spread operator: The spread operator which is three dots: (...) is used for adding, combining, and spreading arrays out

3. React: React is a JavaScript library that is used for building a user interface for web development. It is fast and lightweight and is said to be easy to use as it combines basic HTML with JavaScript concepts

4. React props: React props are arguments used within React. Props stands for properties so it would be used to give components properties, like HTML attributes.

5. DOM events: DOM events or Document Object Model events are used as signals that an event has occured. These events can be triggered by user interaction, such as a user clicking their mouse or any event that happens on a website like the site loading, an image loading etc.
